-- Exercise 1
{-|
 - use enumFromTo to construct a list with all the skip distances
 - use map to apply everyNth to each skip distance
 - (wouldnâ€™t need flip if everyNth were defined as [a] -> Int -> [a]
 - but I believe Int -> [a] -> [a] is more sensible)
 -}
skips :: [a] -> [[a]]
skips a = map (flip everyNth a) (enumFromTo 1 $ length a)

{-|
 - use drop and chunksOf to break list up where we need it
 - use listToMaybe and catMaybes to safely get the first
 - item in each list
 -}
everyNth :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
everyNth n =
    drop (n - 1)
    >>> chunksOf n
    >>> map listToMaybe
    >>> catMaybes
