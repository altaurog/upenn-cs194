fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = (fib (n - 1)) + (fib (n - 2))

fibs1 :: [Integer]
fibs1 = map fib [0..]

-- exercise 2 - dumb approach
fib2 = memoize fibm

fibm :: Integer -> Integer
fibm 0 = 0
fibm 1 = 1
fibm n = (fib2 (n - 1)) + (fib2 (n - 2))

fibs2 :: [Integer]
fibs2 = map fib2 [0..]

-- exercise 2 - handcrafted approach
{- fibonacci sequence is inherently recursive,
 - donâ€™t need to compute as function of index,
 - but do need additional state (penultimate value)
 -}
fibs2' :: [Integer]
fibs2' = map fst $ fm (0, 1)

fm :: (Integer, Integer) -> [(Integer, Integer)]
fm (a, b) = (a, b) : (fm (b, a + b))
